# GeneratorSerialization

A custom CSLA serializer using C# source generators.

## Getting Started

Reference the `CslaGeneratorSerialization` [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CslaGeneratorSerialization). You also need to reference `CSLA` as well, though if you're using this generator, you are probably already referencing `CSLA`.

### Prerequisites

The `CslaGeneratorSerialization` package targets .NET Standard 2.0, though the code it emits is not limited to .NET Standard 2.0.

## Usage

Please read the [Overview document](https://github.com/JasonBock/CslaGeneratorSerialization/blob/main/docs/Overview.md) for information on how to use this library.
